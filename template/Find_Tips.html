         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">1.Soil preparation:</b> Bell peppers grow best in well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter. Before planting, prepare the soil by adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and texture.</li>
         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">2.Watering:</b> Bell peppers require consistent watering to produce healthy fruits. Avoid over-watering or under-watering, as both can affect plant growth and yield. Water deeply but infrequently, and ensure that the soil is evenly moist but not waterlogged.</li>
         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">3.Fertilization:</b> Bell peppers require adequate nutrients to grow and produce healthy fruits. Use a balanced fertilizer with equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this can lead to excessive vegetative growth and poor fruit production.</li>
         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">4.Pest management:</b> Bell peppers are susceptible to pests such as aphids, thrips, and spidermites. Practice good pest management by monitoring your plants regularly and using natural methods such as companion planting and beneficial insects to control pests. If necessary, use organic pesticides only as a last resort.</li>
         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">5.Harvesting:</b> Harvest bell peppers when they are mature but still firm and glossy. Leaving them on the plant too long can result in over-ripening and reduced quality. Use sharp shears or a knife to cut the fruit from the plant, taking care not to damage the stem or plant.</li>

         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">1.Use disease-resistant varieties:</b> Use pepper varieties that are resistant to bacterial spot. Check with your local nursery or seed supplier for recommended varieties that are adapted to your area.</li>
         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">2.Crop rotation:</b> Rotate your pepper plants with non-related crops to reduce the buildup of the bacteria in the soil.</li>
         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">3.Practice good sanitation:</b> Remove and destroy all infected plant debris, including fruits and leaves. Do not compost the infected plant material, as the bacteria can survive in compost.</li>   
         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">4.Avoid overhead watering:</b> Bacterial spot spreads through water, so avoid overhead watering of your pepper plants. Use a drip irrigation system or a watering can to water your plants at the base.</li>
         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">5.Practice good hygiene:</b> Wash your hands and gardening tools thoroughly before and after working with your pepper plants to avoid spreading the bacteria.</li>   
         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">6.Apply copper-based fungicides:</b> Apply copper-based fungicides as a preventative measure or at the first sign of infection. Follow the label instructions carefully.</li>
         <li><b style="color: #333; font-weight: bold;font-size: 0.6cm;">7.Use chemical control:</b> If bacterial spot is severe, you may need to use chemical control methods. Consult with your local agricultural extension office or a licensed professional for recommendations on the best products and application methods.</li>
